## RUN package with react-app example

<i>It is highly recommended for you to use two terminals side by side, to run the package and the example. </i>

<i>You might need to `yarn i` in each of the steps, if it's the first time you are running.</i>

<b>TERMINAL 1- Run the following to compile the src folder and watch for changes</b>

```bash
yarn start
```

<b>TERMINAL 2- Run the following to startup the react-app example</b>

```bash
cd example && npm start
```
